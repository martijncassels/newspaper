/**
 * The Tracing module provides mechanisms for registering to receive tracing

 * This module is pretty similar to a standard EventEmitter, but has a few
 * key differences. This module provides the ability to filter out which
 * events you would like to receive, based on criteria of your choosing.
 *
 * Tracing can hurt performance in some cases, and filtering is a way for
 * the profiling application to improve performance whenever the data is not
 * explicitly needed.
